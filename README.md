# Ali Saboohi . Jarvis Consulting

Hi, I'm a recent computer science graduate from Ryerson university. During the four years my main focus was on backend development, machine learning and computer vision. In Jarvis, I became proficient in technologies such as git, docker, Java ,RDBMS/SQL, Hadoop, Spark etc. Looking forward to become a Big Data Engineer.

## Jarvis Projects

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AliSaboohi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Objective of this project was to design an MVP in order to gather hardware specifications and resource usage of each node in a Linux cluster. In Jarvis, the Linux cluster administration team manages a Linux cluster of ten nodes running Centos7. These nodes are internally connected through a switch and able to communicate through internal IPv4 addresses. The administration team has requested a bash agent program that is installed on each node and gathers the requested data. The collected data is inserted into a Postgres database instance which is pulled from Docker Hub. Moreover, the LCA team will use the data to generate reports for future resource planning purposes. In order to make decision making easier, a queries file has been created for the administration team to see what nodes have the highest memory and number of CPUs, what is their usage over a five minute interval and detecting failures.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AliSaboohi/tree/master/core_java)]:
