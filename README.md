# Ali Saboohi . Jarvis Consulting

Hi, I'm a recent graduate from Ryerson university with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my four years at Ryerson my main focus was on backend development, machine learning and computer vision where I worked on many projects such as Face Detection application using HOG features, Handwrite Recognition application and created a few websites. Currently, I am a Software and Data Engineer at Jarvis where I am trained to master the tools and frameworks necessary for professional work enviroment such as Git, Docker, Java, Spring boot, RDBMS, Maven etc. In addition to this, I have a passion for the insights data can provide. My experiences taught me how to come up with creative solutions to the real-world problems and I am looking forward to bring my experiences and skills to your team.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AliSaboohi](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AliSaboohi)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AliSaboohi/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Objective of this project was to design an MVP in order to gather hardware specifications and resource usage of each node in a Linux cluster. In Jarvis, the Linux cluster administration team manages a Linux cluster of ten nodes running Centos7. These nodes are internally connected through a switch and able to communicate through internal IPv4 addresses. The administration team has requested a bash agent program that is installed on each node and gathers the requested data. The collected data is inserted into a Postgres database instance which is pulled from Docker Hub. Moreover, the LCA team will use the data to generate reports for future resource planning purposes. In order to make decision making easier, a queries file has been created for the administration team to see what nodes have the highest memory and number of CPUs, what is their usage over a five minute interval and detecting failures.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AliSaboohi/tree/master/core_java)]:

## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2020-present)**: Collaborated with a Software and Data engineering team in an Agile enviroment in order to work on various projects using technologies, tools and frameworks such as git, Maven, Java, PostgresSQL, IntelliJ, Docker and bash just to name a few. Attended daily scrum meetings as well as bi-weekly sprint retrospectives. Additionaly, studied and practiced new technologies and better ways to come up with better solutions to the real-world problems.
