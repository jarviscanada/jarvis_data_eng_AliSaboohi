# Ali Saboohi . Jarvis Consulting

I'm a recent graduate from Ryerson University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my four years at Ryerson, my main focus was on backend development, machine learning and computer vision, where I worked on many projects such as Face Detection application using HOG features, Handwrite Recognition application and created a few websites. Currently, I am a Software and Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I am trained to master the tools and frameworks necessary for a professional work environment such as Git, Docker, Java, Spring boot, RDBMS, Maven etc. In addition to this, I have a passion for the insights data can provide. My experiences taught me how to come up with creative solutions to real-world problems, and I am looking forward to bringing my experiences and skills to your team.
