# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I'm a recent graduate from Ryerson University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my four years at Ryerson, my main focus was on backend development, machine learning and computer vision, where I worked on many projects such as Face Detection application using HOG features, Handwrite Recognition application and created a few websites. Currently, I am a Software and Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I am trained to master the tools and frameworks necessary for a professional work environment such as Git, Docker, Java, Spring boot, RDBMS, Maven etc. In addition to this, I have a passion for the insights data can provide. My experiences taught me how to come up with creative solutions to real-world problems, and I am looking forward to bringing my experiences and skills to your team.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring agent using bash scripts to collect hardware information and usage of each node in real-time. The collected information is persisted into a PostgreSQL database instance provisioned using a Docker container. The usage is being collected continuously using crontab. Additionally, wrote SQL queries to query data for later data analysis, failure detection as an example.

  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      #Keywords: Java 8, REST API, OAuth, Design patterns (e.g. DAO, MVC), JUnit, Mockito, Docker
      # Keywords: Java 8, JDBC, RDBMS, SQL, CRUD,DAO
      - "JDBC App: Developed and implemented a simple Java application that leverages JDBC to make a connection to a Postgres database. PostgreSQL database instance provisioned using a Docker container. The objective of this project was to implement a DAO to be able to better understand the CRUD operations using one or any number of tables in the database. The project is managed and built using Maven."
      # Keywords: Java 8, Lambda, Stream API, IntelliJ
      - "Grep App: Designed and developed a java 8 maven structured application to recreate a simplified version of the Linux grep command. The program takes a pattern, a root directory, and an output file as arguments and then, proceeds to recursively search the directory to find all the files and find the user-given pattern in all the lines. Furthermore, when lines are found the program writes the lines to an output file."

      - "Twitter App: Developed and designed a Java program for users to post, show and delete tweets from the command line. This program uses an HTTP client to interact with the Twitter REST API. The main objective of this project was to get comfortable with technologies such as REST APIs and Java libraries such as Apache HTTP Components and Signpost OAuth library to authenticate and send requests to Twitter REST API as well as Jackson for parsing and processing JSON."

  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: "Delivered a proof of concept (POC) project that helps the LGS marketing team by analyzing customer shopping behavior. The main objective of this project was to utilize Jupyter Notebook, Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis. In addition to this, the client retail data was loaded and used for analysis using a Postgres data warehouse."

  - name: "Hadoop"
    git_url: "/hadoop"
    description: "The Jarvis Data Engineering team requested an analysis on a table called World Development Indicator (WDI) taken from Google's BigQuery. The main objective of this project was to first, learn core Hadoop concepts: HDFS, MapReduce, Yarn, and second, to analyze data using Hive and Zeppelin on a Hadoop cluster created using Google Cloud dataproc."
